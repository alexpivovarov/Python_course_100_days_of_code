I started learning with the course "100 days of Python" by Dr. Angela Yu on October 25th 2023 and achieved an intermediate level.

I worked in the IDE PyCharm and then copied the files to GitHub.

As my experience grew I reviewed my older files and made modifications sometimes completely changing the code. Initial versions are available in the history of the files.
