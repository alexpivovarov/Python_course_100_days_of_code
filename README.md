I started learning with the course "100 days of Python" by Dr. Angela Yu at the 25th of October and achieved an intermediate level.

I worked in IDE PyCharm and then copied files to GitHub.

As my experience grew I reviewed my older files and made modifications sometimes fully changing the code. Initial versions are available in the history of the files.
